BHS_COIN

I wanted to make a coin for my highschool to reward students with Berwick High School or BHS_COIN, it's set up so that when it's properly funded the top 3 students with the most BHS coin will each get $1000 worth of ETH so they can spend it on books or other college material. Obviously this is the ideal scenario they could really spend it on whatever they like. This is still a work in progress but I have set up a very basic GUI via an html webpage for local use only for testing.
